# Data-Revolution-Power-BI-Transformation-for-Axon-Classic-Cars
Problem Statement : A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.

Transformed Axon's data management using Power BI. This involved data cleaning, transformation, EDA, and dynamic visualization. By centralizing data and introducing interactive features, I facilitated data-driven decision-making, boosted operational efficiency, and drove significant revenue growth.
